Authentication
==============

Open OnDemand supports most authentication mechanisms that works with an Apache
HTTP Server. The Overview below explains the basic steps to take when setting up
Authentication. We also provide a tutorial installing Keycloak as an OpenID
Connect provider and then using that for authentication with OnDemand.

If you are using an authentication module that is not represented here,
please consider letting us know how you set it up so we can add walkthrough here.
Or fork this documentation repo and create a pull request off of the develop
branch with your walkthrough.
