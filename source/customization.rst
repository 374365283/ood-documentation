Add shortcuts to Files menu
---------------------------

The Files menu by default has a single link to open the Files app in the user's
Home Directory. More links can be added to this menu, for Scratch space and
Project space directories.

Adding more links currently requires adding a custom initializer to the
Dashboard app. Ruby code is placed in the initializer to add one or more Ruby
``Pathname`` objects to the ``OodFilesApp.candidate_favorite_paths`` array, a
global attribute that is used in the Dashboard app.

Start by creating the file
:file:`/etc/ood/config/apps/dashboard/initializers/ood.rb` as such:

.. code-block:: ruby

   # /etc/ood/config/apps/dashboard/initializers/ood.rb

   OodFilesApp.candidate_favorite_paths.tap do |paths|
     # add project space directories
     projects = User.new.groups.map(&:name).grep(/^P./)
     paths.concat projects.map { |p| Pathname.new("/fs/project/#{p}")  }

     # add scratch space directories
     paths << Pathname.new("/fs/scratch/#{User.new.name}")
     paths.concat projects.map { |p| Pathname.new("/fs/scratch/#{p}")  }
   end

- The variable ``paths`` is an array of ``Pathname`` objects that define a list
  of what will appear in the Dashboard menu for Files
- At OSC, the pattern for project paths follows
  :file:`/fs/project/{project_name}`. So above we:

  #. get an array of all user's groups by name
  #. filter that array for groups that start with ``P`` (i.e., ``PZS0002``,
     ``PAW0003``, ...)
  #. using ``map`` we turn this array into an array of ``Pathname`` objects to
     all the possible project directories the user could have.
  #. extend the paths array with this list of paths

- For possible scratch space directories, we look for either
  :file:`/fs/scratch/{project_name}` or :file:`/fs/scratch/{user_name}`

On each request, the Dashboard will check for the existence of the directories
in ``OodFilesApp.candidate_favorite_paths`` array and whichever directories
exist and the user has access to will appear as links in the Files menu under
the Home Directory link.

- You must restart the Dashboard app to see a configuration change take effect.
  This can be forced from the Dashboard itself by selecting
  *Help* â†’ *Restart Web Server* from the top right menu.

If you access the Dashboard, and it crashes, then you may have made a mistake
in ``ood.rb`` file, whose code is run during the initialization of the Rails
app.
