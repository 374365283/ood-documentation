# Architecture readme for developers and documenters

The files `.png` and `.drawio` files in this directory were created from [draw.io](draw.io).  This was a manual 
procedure and in the future when you need to update any of these images simply follow the steps below. 

This readme is really just a reminder of where this stuff came from, and how to get it back to update them 
in the future.

1. Upload the given .drawio file to the draw.io website
2. Edit on draw.io as neeeded.
3. Save the new .drawio file and replace the one in this directory
4. Export the drawing as a .png on the website.
5. Replace the cooresponding .png in this directory with the one you just exported.
6. Commit your changes, then follow the rest of the source code change process.
