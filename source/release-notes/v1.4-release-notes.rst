Details
-------

Upgrade to Ruby 2.4, NodeJS 6, Passenger 5
............................................

This upgrade updates our dependencies to Software Collections Ruby 2.4 and NodeJS 6. Passenger is also seeing an upgrade to version 5, but until Passenger 5 is supported by SCL OSC will host the Passenger 5 and NGINX 1.14 RPMs which are built based on "@efranz where did we get the Passenger RPM build information from?".

.. note::

  The Per User NGINX temporary directory has been moved from `/var/lib/nginx/` to `/var/tmp/nginx` due to an issue with more restrictive permissions with NGINX 1.14.

Security Enhancement: Enable whitelisting directories users can navigate to in files app
........................................................................................

The file editor, file browser and job composer now support a whitelist of browseable/editable directories. Directories and files not in the whitelist will never be forbidden to users. The whitelist is controlled by the environment variable ``WHITELIST_PATH``, which is best be defined by editing ``/etc/ood/config/nginx_stage.yml`` under the ``custom_env`` map. If no whitelist is provided the feature is disabled.

Security Enhancement: App development mode is disabled by default
.................................................................

Development mode disabled by default: application development gives increased access to a system (e.g. `Security Enhancement: Require SSH for all hosts in Shell app`_), and should only be enabled for trusted users. To re-enable a user as an application developer: TODO list steps

Security Enhancement: Require SSH for all hosts in Shell app
.............................................................

Prior to this release it was possible for OOD users to change the URL in the shell application and connect directly to the web node by starting a Bash shell on localhost. Given that this ability for arbitrary user access is counter intuitive to how web servers are typically managed, the exemption for localhost has been removed; users will always use SSH to connect to any host, allowing SSH access controls to work.

Fixed copy paste issues in the Shell app
..........................................

Resolved a pair of issues (`#48 <https://github.com/OSC/ood-shell/issues/48>`_, `#55 <https://github.com/OSC/ood-shell/issues/55>`_) that caused problems with copy and paste in the Shell application.

Optional Quota warnings on dashboard
......................................

The Dashboard can now display a configurable disk usage warning to the user if they approach a certain usage threshold. This feature is enabled by defining the environment variable ``OOD_QUOTA_PATH`` which can take a colon delimited path, and may be defined in ``/etc/ood/config/nginx_stage.yml`` under the ``custom_env`` map. The version 1 format for quota files is defined in the `Dashboard README <https://github.com/OSC/ood-dashboard/blob/v1.30.2/README.md#disk-quota-warnings>`__.

Experimental SGE/UGE support
..............................

A `job adapter has been written </installation/resource-manager/sge.html>`__ that supports Sun Grid Engine derivatives. The adapter is known to be compatible with SGE 6.2u5 and Univa GE 8.0.1. Thanks to UCLA for donating access to Hoffman2 to aid in development of the adapter.

Add ability to include Javascript in Batch Connect apps
.........................................................

Batch Connect applications may now define up to two automatically included Javascript files to add interactive frontend functionality.

TODO add link to update Dashboard docs

Better environment setting
..........................

The file ``/etc/ood/config/nginx_stage.yml`` now includes two methods to set the PUN environment. Populating the mapping ``custom_env`` allows sites to define OOD specific environment variables that will be added to the PUN environment. Defining the sequence ``pun_custom_env_declarations`` confers the ability to define an arbitrary list of env vars to declare in the PUN config (so they are retained from whatever is set in /etc/ood/profile).
