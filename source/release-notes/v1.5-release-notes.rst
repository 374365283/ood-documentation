v1.5 Release Notes
==================

Highlights in 1.5:

- `Add ondemand SCL and use SCL nginx and passenger`_

Upgrading from v1.4
-------------------

.. warning::

  As always please update the *development* or *test* instances of OnDemand installed at your center first before you modify the *production* instance.

#. Update OnDemand release RPM

   CentOS/RHEL 6

   .. code-block:: sh

      sudo yum install -y https://yum.osc.edu/ondemand/1.5/ondemand-release-web-1.5-1.el6.noarch.rpm

   CentOS/RHEL 7

   .. code-block:: sh

      sudo yum install -y https://yum.osc.edu/ondemand/1.5/ondemand-release-web-1.5-1.el7.noarch.rpm

#. Update OnDemand

   .. code-block:: sh

       sudo yum clean all
       sudo yum update ondemand

   .. warning::

      The nginx RPM used by ondemand in 1.4 is no longer maintained. If you use nginx outside of OnDemand it's recommended to re-install using nginx from repositories such as EPEL after upgrading OnDemand to 1.5.

      .. code-block:: sh

          sudo yum downgrade nginx nginx-filesystem --disablerepo=ondemand-web

#. Optionally remove dependencies from prior versions of OOD if they are not used by other applications.

   .. code-block:: sh

       sudo yum remove nginx nginx-filesystem passenger

#. Clean up NGINX directories from prior versions of OOD

   The ondemand RPM should have copied all the nginx configurations, tmp files and logs from their previous locations to their new locations if the defaults were not changed. Once the functionality of the OnDemand 1.5 upgrade is verified it is safe to remove these old paths.

   .. warning:: If the host running OnDemand has other applications using NGINX then special care needs to be taken not to delete files belonging to the other applications.

   .. warning:: At the very minimum ``/var/lib/nginx/config`` needs to be deleted as that path is used by the ondemand RPM to determine if upgrades are taking place from 1.4 to 1.5.

   .. code-block:: sh

       sudo rm -rf /var/lib/nginx/config
       sudo rm -rf /var/tmp/nginx/*
       sudo rm -rf /var/log/nginx/*

Upgrading from v1.3
-------------------

.. warning::

  As always please update the *development* or *test* instances of OnDemand installed at your center first before you modify the *production* instance.

#. Update OnDemand release RPM

   CentOS/RHEL 6

   .. code-block:: sh

      sudo yum install -y https://yum.osc.edu/ondemand/1.5/ondemand-release-web-1.5-1.el6.noarch.rpm

   CentOS/RHEL 7

   .. code-block:: sh

      sudo yum install -y https://yum.osc.edu/ondemand/1.5/ondemand-release-web-1.5-1.el7.noarch.rpm

#. Update OnDemand

   .. code-block:: sh

       sudo yum clean all
       sudo yum update ondemand

#. Optionally remove dependencies from prior versions of OOD

   .. code-block:: sh

       sudo yum remove nodejs010\* rh-passenger40\* rh-ruby22\* nginx16\* git19\* v8314\*

#. Clean up NGINX directories from prior versions of OOD

   The ondemand RPM should have copied all the nginx configurations, tmp files and logs from their previous locations to their new locations if the defaults were not changed. Once the functionality of the OnDemand 1.5 upgrade is verified it is safe to remove these old paths.

   .. warning:: If the host running OnDemand has other applications using NGINX then special care needs to be taken not to delete files belonging to the other applications.

   .. code-block:: sh

       sudo rm -rf /var/lib/nginx/config.rpmsave
       sudo rm -rf /var/lib/nginx/tmp/*
       sudo rm -rf /var/log/nginx/*

#. Rebuild any custom Node.js or Ruby apps

   Since we upgraded to Ruby 2.4 from 2.2 and NodeJS 0.10 to NodeJS 6 any custom
   Passenger apps in Ruby or NodeJS that have their dependencies installed in
   vendor/bundle or node_modules will need to be reinstalled. Some code may have
   to be updated or dependency versions changed to work with the latest Ruby version.

   For NodeJS apps:

   .. code-block: sh

      cd /var/www/ood/apps/sys/custom_nodejs_app
      sudo rm -rf node_modules
      sudo scl enable ondemand -- npm install

   For Ruby apps:

   .. code-block: sh

      cd /var/www/ood/apps/sys/custom_nodejs_app
      sudo rm -rf vendor/bundle
      sudo scl enable ondemand -- bundle install --path vendor/bundle

   If you need a way to continue to still use Ruby 2.2 or a different version of
   NodeJS `please post a question on our Discourse instance <https://discourse.osc.edu>`_.

#. Verify Navbar contains all the apps you want.

   The behavior changed from 1.3 to 1.5 so by default all categories of any sys
   app found appear as dropdown menus without the need for configuration changes.


   As a result menus may appear that you do not expect, if previously you were relying
   on the "whitelist" functionality of the ``NavConfig.categories``.

   See :ref:`dashboard-navbar-config` for details.

#. Verify Developer mode is configured how you want it

   See :ref:`enabling-development-mode` for an explanation of how developer mode has changed
   between 1.3 and 1.5 and how to configure things properly. For sites that have active
   developers, this will either be adding configuration to revert to 1.3's functionality,
   or creating some directories and symlinks to enable specific app developers.

Infrastructure Version Changes
------------------------------

OnDemand's infrastructure components have been merged into a monolithic repository. Component changelogs have been frozen and the parent repository will now track all infrastructure changes: `OnDemand 1.5.1 <https://github.com/OSC/ondemand/blob/v1.5.1/CHANGELOG.md>`__. `Diff with 1.4.10 <https://github.com/OSC/ondemand/compare/v1.4.10...v1.5.1>`__

Details
-------

Add ondemand SCL and use SCL nginx and passenger
................................................

This upgrade adds a new ``ondemand`` software collection that is the only software collection needed to interact with OnDemand. This new softare collection will load all the collections needed by OnDemand. The Passenger and NGINX dependencies have been repackaged under this new ``ondemand`` SCL so those packages will no longer interfere with Passenger of NGINX packages from other repositories.

.. warning::

  Several NGINX directories used by OnDemand have changed.
    - ``/var/lib/nginx`` to ``/var/lib/ondemand-nginx``
    - ``/var/tmp/nginx`` to ``/var/tmp/ondemand-nginx``
    - ``/var/log/nginx`` to ``/var/log/ondemand-nginx``
