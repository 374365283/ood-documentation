Install From Source
===================

The alternative to installing OnDemand using RPMs is to install from source. This tutorial will assume installation on a CentOS/RHEL 7 base. Installation on other systems is possible, but installing compatible versions of certain dependencies is left as an exercise for the interested. Use of nested dependencies specific to CentOS/RHEL such as Software Collections will be called out.
