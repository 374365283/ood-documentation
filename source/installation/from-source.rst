The alternative to installing the core of OnDemand using RPMs is to install from source. This tutorial will assume installation on a CentOS/RHEL 7 base. We will look at how to install the core of OnDemand, while still using some OSC-provided RPMs to ensure a functioning build without having to go into too much detail. Installation on non-RPM-based systems is possible, but installing compatible versions of certain dependencies is left as an exercise for the interested.
