Open OnDemand
=============

Our `website`_ contains general information about the Open OnDemand project.

Community contributions
-----------------------

Throughout this documentation we will start highlighting community
contributions to the project, including linking to external useful projects or
extensions such as `PSC's Jupyter Notebook extension
<https://github.com/PSC-PublicHealth/pha-nbextensions>`_ for manipulating the
environment post launch.

.. note::

   If you have an app or extension that may be useful to others in the
   OnDemand community please share on our `Discourse <https://discourse.osc.edu/c/open-ondemand>`_ instance and we can then
   also add it to this documentation site.
