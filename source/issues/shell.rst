Huge Files and Noisy Programs
-----------------------------------

When using the ``cat`` command on a bigger file or when you are trying to run a noisy program like Spark, it causes performance problems.

Cut and Paste in MS Edge
-----------------------------------

When cutting and pasting, you may paste twice in MS Edge (pre-Chrome)

.. figure:: /images/issues-shell-cutpaste1.png

.. figure:: /images/issues-shell-cutpaste2.png
   :align: center

As you can see, when the text was pasted it was pasted twice.
